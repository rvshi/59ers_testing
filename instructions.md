# Converting Module to Class

You will work on this assignment **individually** (not with your team).

* Fork your team repository from `v2.0.0` of your testing assignment repository
  into your individual user account.
* Convert your module to a class, keeping the following in mind:
  + Your module functions should become class methods.
  + Your class should have a initializer (`def __init__():`) to pass input
    values into the instantiated class.  
  + Your initializer should also create "placeholder" attributes that will be
    assigned values when your methods are executed.  These placeholders should
    be set to `None` in the initializer. 
* Your unit tests will need to be updated to accommodate the transition to a class.
* Maintain your docstrings and ability to build your Sphinx documentation.
* Make sure to keep using good software development practices (e.g., git feature branch workflow).
* Create an annotated tag (`v3.0.0`) when your assignment is complete.
